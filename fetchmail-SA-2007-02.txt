0. Release history
==================

2007-07-29 1.0	first release


1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

fetchmail ships with a graphical, Python/Tkinter based configuration
utility named "fetchmailconf" to help the user create configuration (run
control) files for fetchmail.


2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

fetchmail will generated warning messages to the local postmaster or user in
certain circumstances, for instance when authentication fails.

If this warning message is refused by the SMTP listener that fetchmail is
talking to, fetchmail attempts to dereference a NULL pointer when trying to find
out if it should allow a bounce message to be sent.


3. Solution
===========

Install fetchmail 6.3.9 or newer.  The fetchmail source code is available from
<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>.
