6.3.6:
- move .html files from list archive to some doc directory
- Zak's further minor issues
- Debian Bug #400950: SSL cert CN overrides --user, since
  GÃ¶tz Nimrill's authenticate external patch.
- check manpage/fetchmail.h and code which exit statuses are
  actually used and clean up
- does libresolv or libc (glibc) or something cache resolver
  addresses??? If so, that's a severe bug in the resp. lib.

6.3.7:
- more SMTP/LMTP error detail on message rejections even outside verbose mode.
  Ian D. Allen, fetchmail-users. Two messages with examples.
  What goes here? fetchmailrc location, server, port, user, folder, anything else?

CODE:
- check recent list mail
- check Debian BTS and other bug trackers
- better logging (log all headers, log forward destination + method)
- check strict envelope N Received parsing,
  see mail from Admin Att on fetchmail-users
- 6.3.4-pending-deletes.patch
- fetchmail -s with running daemon complains rather than silently
  restarting daemon
- send warning message when connection fails?
- when logging to syslog, disable locale?
- check FAQ O5 - do we really prefer From: over envelope?!?
- add code to allow safe authentication schemes if TLS fails

DOCUMENTATION:
- document Received: parsing expectations
- Add info whether Keywords are global, server or user keywords
- review sample.rcfile and document it
- consolidate multidrop documentation
