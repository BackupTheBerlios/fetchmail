soon:
- find a solution for the "invalid header" discards message problem
  (escape headers and stuff reminder into body)
- https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=246829

6.4:
- make the SSL default v3 (rather than v23).
- put more hints to the FAQ (should we call it FGA?) as first support place
- make sure we print socket error messages such as connection reset by
  peer to hint users the problem is not in fetchmail
- > b) When the envelope header is specified, but it isn't found, a
  > warning is logged and the mail is forwarded to the postmaster
  > ("WARNING: Envelope header $HEADER found, cannot identify the
  > recipient.  Forwarding to the postmaster")

  Ian D. Allen, fetchmail-users. Two messages with examples.
  What goes here? fetchmailrc location, server, port, user, folder, anything else?
- see if "AUTH SSH" can be made to work for POP3
- revisit BerliOS patches
- check recent list mail
- check Debian BTS and other bug trackers
- better logging (log all headers, log forward destination + method)
- check strict envelope N Received parsing,
  see mail from Admin Att on fetchmail-users
- 6.3.4-pending-deletes.patch
- fetchmail -s with running daemon complains rather than silently
  restarting daemon
- send warning message when connection fails?
- when logging to syslog, disable locale?
- check FAQ O5 - do we really prefer From: over envelope?!?
- add code to allow safe authentication schemes if TLS fails
- make APOP an authenticator, integrate with regular auto authentication
  but stuff it at the end
- use SASL?
