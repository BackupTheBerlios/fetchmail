- Run "perl dist-tools/makerelease" - this entails "make distcheck" and
  RPM building.

- Tag the new release and record the revision in RELEASE-VERSIONS

- Upload sig and tarball to ~/public_html/fetchmail/ and edit index.html
  for the new files, NEWS, and the new release and last update.

- Upload sig and tarball to ftp.berlios.de:/incoming/ and release

- Upload lsm and tarball to ibiblio.org:/incoming/linux/

- Update the fetchmail website for version, link to release nodes
  (update release_id) and last update, commit, and upload.

- Announce on freshmeat.
