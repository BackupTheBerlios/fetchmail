			README for popclient 3.0

popclient is a full-featured, robust, well-documented POP2, POP3 and
APOP client originally developed by Carl Harris <ceharris@mal.com> and
now maintained by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>.

You can find the latest version of popclient from Eric's home page

	http://www.ccil.org/~esr

Features of POP include:

	* POP2, POP3 and APOP support

	* Easy configuration via command line or free-format .poprc file.

	* Daemon mode --  popmail can be run in background to poll
	  one or more hosts at a specified interval.

	* Delivery via either file-append with mandatory locking or an
	  MDA you specify.

	* From:, To:, Cc:, and Reply-To: headers are rewritten so that 
	  usernames relative to the popclient host become fiully-qualified
	  Internet addresses.  This enables replies to work correctly.

There is a man page at popclient.man.  A sample rc file is at sample.poprc.
For a release history, see the file NEWS.
