			README for popclient 3.0

popclient is a full-featured, robust, well-documented POP2, POP3 and

Features of POP include:

	* POP2, POP3 and APOP support

	* Easy configuration via command line or free-format .poprc file.

	* Daemon mode --  popmail can be run in background to poll
	  one or more hosts at a specified interval.

	* Delivery via either file-append with mandatory locking or an
	  MDA you specify.
