FDBK 3 #286899	fetchmail: Problem with PID file

FDBK 3 #294547	fetchmail: has to be manually restarted after a while
		NOTE: appears to be regular network problem?
		but might also be a FD leak (check lsof?)

FDBK 3 #314509	fetchmail: lost mail, or only calculation error?
		Perhaps the server cannot count.
		NOTE: need to review if this causes buffer overrun
		problems.
