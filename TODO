20060213T122015 [  53: Frederic Marchal] [fetchmail-users] Incorrect header line and lost mails

See if fetchmail still segfaults (see quotes of Frederic Marchal
2006-02-17):

Yves Boisjoly reports that NTLM auth needs to use the real Wks field
rather than duplicating the user name (see l. 211 in smbutil.c).

Make fetchmailconf a noarch RPM (needs %ifarch hacks and running
rpmbuild twice).

fetchmail -vvvv --syslog prints blank lines on the screen.
Probably uid.c lines 254 and 265.
