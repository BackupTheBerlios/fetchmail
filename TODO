20060213T122015 [  53: Frederic Marchal] [fetchmail-users] Incorrect header line and lost mails

See if fetchmail still segfaults (see quotes of Frederic Marchal
2006-02-17):
> In fetchmail, the problem is clearly located in transact.c (I wouldn't

Validate --mda/mda option so that single quotes (') around the
placeholders are rejected Debian Bug #347909

Add FAQ entry about procmail configuration with 1. ORGMAIL/DEFAULT, 2.
:0e { EXITCODE=75 HOST }, 3. explicit default recipe, 4. LOGFILE
location?

Yves Boisjoly reports that NTLM auth needs to use the real Wks field
rather than duplicating the user name (see l. 211 in smbutil.c).

Make fetchmailconf a noarch RPM (needs %ifarch hacks and running
rpmbuild twice).


For later:
==========

Add a warning when mda contains sendmail but not -i, -oi, -O IgnoreDots

IDN

Pipeline commands

Allow to query multiple servers simultaneously.

Privilege separation model for added security.

Check if fetchmail's notion of \Recent vs. * <n> RECENT is a working
model at all. In concurrent sessions, fetchmail might not be notified of
\Recent and will have to check UID instead.

RFC2047 encode X-Fetchmail-Warning?
X-Fetchmail-Warning: Empfängeradresse root@example.org stimmt mit keinem lokalen Namen überein
X-Virus-Scanned: amavisd-new at m2a2.dyndns.org
X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER Non-encoded 8-bit data (char C3 hex) in message header 'X-Fetchmail-Warning': X-Fetchmail-Warning: +Empf\303\244ngeradresse ro...

check if --monitor still works properly
and complete CAN_MONITOR vs. interface checks
complete CAN_MONITOR replacement

put all getaddrinfo compat cruft into an easy-to-use m4 macro for
autoconf and Makefile.am snippet for automake, so people can just use it
without further hassle.

fetchmail -vvvv --syslog prints blank lines on the screen.
Probably uid.c lines 254 and 265.
