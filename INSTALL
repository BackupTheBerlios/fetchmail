		INSTALL Instructions for fetchmail

Installing fetchmail is easy.  From within this directory, type:

	./configure

The autoconfiguration script will spend a bit of time figuring out the
specifics of your system.  If you want to specify a particular compiler
(e.g. you have gcc but want to compile with cc), set the environment 
variable CC before you run configure.  

If you're running QNX, edit the distributed Makefile directly.  The
QNX values for various macros are there but commented out; all you
have to do is uncomment them.

Next run

	make

This will compile fetchmail for your system.  Note that in order to
build it, you'll need either flex at version 2.5.3 org greater, or lex.

Lastly, become root and run

	make install

This will install fetchmail.  By default, fetchmail will be installed
in /usr/local/bin, with the man page in /usr/local/man/man1.  If you
wish to change these defaults, edit the Makefile AFTER you run
"configure" but BEFORE you run "make install."  You can easily choose
a prefix other than /usr/local, or you can choose completely different
directories for each item.

See the man page or the file sample.rcfile for a description of how to
configure your individual preferences.

Note: if you have been using popclient (the ancestor of this program)
at version 3.0b6 or later, do this

(cd ~; mv ~/.poprc ~/.fetchmailrc)

in order to migrate.

Enjoy!
