INSTALL Instructions for Popclient

Installing popclient is easy.  From within this directory, type:

	./configure

The autoconfiguration script will spend a bit of time figuring out the
specifics of your system.  If you want to specify a particular compiler
(e.g. you have gcc but want to compile with cc), set the environment 
variable CC before you run configure.  

Next run

	make

This will compile popclient for your system.  Lastly, become root and
run

	make install

This will install popclient.  By default, popclient will be installed
in /usr/local/bin, with the man page in /usr/local/man/man1, and the
GNU info file in /usr/local/info.  If you wish to change these defaults,
edit the Makefile AFTER you run "configure" but BEFORE you run 
"make install."  You can easily choose a prefix other than /usr/local,
or you can choose completely different directories for each item.

See the file sample.poprc for a description of configuring your 
individual preferences.

Enjoy!
